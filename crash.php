                crash course and how it can increase your efficiency and prepare you better for the CSE Examination.
            </p>
            <p><b>Retention of the information:</b></p>
            <p>
                The purpose of a crash course is that it helps in easy retention of information. Psychology says that it
                is easier to retain information for days rather than weeks. Therefore the timing of the crash course is
                just before the exam helping with easy retention of information.
            </p>
            <p><b>Efficient and a quick way for making up for the lost time:</b></p>
            <p>
                The crash course provides a better and comprehensive understanding of the subjects just before the
                prelims. This makes up for the revision time and also helps in covering the topics which aspirants were
                unable to cover due to any reason.
            </p>
            <p><b>Reinforcement of the learning process:</b></p>
            <p>
                While preparing for the civil services examination the students are constantly coming across new
                information. In order to cover the syllabus they often focus on this new information and tend to forget
                the already learnt information. The crash course helps aspirants with revision of the information and
                this repetition of the learning process helps with better absorption of knowledge.
            </p>
            <p><b>High Success Rate:</b></p>
            <p>
                Evidence has suggested that aspirants who go for crash courses are more likely to clear this
                examination. This is due to the rapid fire nature of the course. Constant classes and tests leaves no
                room for aspirants to get bored and this regular mental workout promotes better retention of the
                information.
